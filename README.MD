# Local Food Wastage Management System

## Project Description

This project aims to create a system for managing food donations and reducing food waste by connecting food donors with those in need. The system includes features for authentication and authorization, data management (food listings, providers, receivers, claims), reporting and analysis, and contact management.

## Problem Statement

Food waste is a significant global issue contributing to environmental problems and food insecurity. Many lack access to nutritious food, and current food surplus distribution systems are often inefficient. This project addresses the need for a streamlined, accessible platform to facilitate efficient donation and distribution of surplus food, reducing waste and addressing food insecurity locally.

## Tech Stack

*   **Fabric Warehouse:** For database design and implementation.
*   **PyODBC:** For connecting to the Fabric Warehouse.
*   **Streamlit:** For building the user interface.
*   **Python:** The primary programming language.

## Approach

1.  **Database Design and Implementation:** Design and implement a relational database schema in Fabric Warehouse.
2.  **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement a secure system for user access and permissions.
3.  **Data Ingestion:** Develop methods for data entry and bulk uploads.
4.  **Streamlit Application Development:** Build a user-friendly interface for viewing listings, making claims, managing donations, viewing reports, and managing contacts.
5.  **Reporting and Analytics:** Develop SQL queries and visualizations for key metrics.
6.  **Deployment:** Deploy the Streamlit application and connect it to the Fabric Warehouse.

## Conclusion

This project successfully developed a Local Food Wastage Management System using Fabric Warehouse, PyODBC, and Streamlit. It provides a centralized platform to connect food donors and receivers, aiming to reduce food waste and address food insecurity through secure authentication, comprehensive data management, and insightful reporting.
